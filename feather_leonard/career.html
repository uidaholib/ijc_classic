        <p>Leonard Feather is regarded as a legend in the realm of jazz. His love affair with this music spanned six decades and his list of accomplishments is impressive. He was involved in almost every aspect of the music industry.</p>
        <p>First, Feather was not, by his own admission, much of a business man. This is not to say that he was prone to making questionable choices, only that his motivations were not monetary. He did not exploit artists or their music in order to make a profit. Indeed he had a hard time understanding the nuances of the music business in the beginning and the extent of the abuse of musicians.  Leonard Feather was more interested in jazz as an art and a creative process, with little regard for potential profit or the reservations of businessmen and potential critics. He lamented the times when recordings were locked away in a vault or the masters were destroyed, not so much because of the lost money or recognition, but because the music would never be heard by the public.</p>
        <p>Second, Leonard was not an artist manager. When he was once characterized as a manager he thought, not only was he not managing others, but he could have used a good manager himself.</p>
        <p>Lastly, even though he did work as a press agent from 1941 to 1943, he was never really a publicist. After less than three years he gave up his two remaining accounts, Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton, and returned to his journalism work. In fact he later did not even like being reminded he had ever been in the publicity game. Aside from those three roles, Feather had a hand in almost every other aspect of jazz music: journalist and critic, arranger and producer, musician and author, teacher and historian. His talent and extensive contributions went into records, concerts, radio, television, movies, books, and periodicals. </p>
